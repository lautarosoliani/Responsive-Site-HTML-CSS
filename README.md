<h1>🔎 RESPONSIVE: Desktop & Mobile</h1>
This project consists of seven sections, distributed vertically. Each section has a display expectation according to the two views to fulfill (desktop and mobile).
The goal is to ensure your viewing is responsive and well designed.
For instance, the navigation menu changes between its versions for desktop and mobile respectively. You can see it in action with the following GIF!
